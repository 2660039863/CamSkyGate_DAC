# CamSkyGate_DAC  

1. This repositories contain the skyrmion simulations what are related to the following publication:
   Y. Zhang, C. Tang, P. Li, and U. Guin, "CamSkyGate: Camouflaged Skyrmion Gates for Protecting ICs" , Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2022
   
2. THe folder "simple gate" includes the simulations of two differnt simple CamSkyGates with two inputs: AND/OR and OR/BUFFER. Each CamSkyGate is provided with the simulation of      all input combinations except "00".

3. THe folder "complexgate" includes the simulations of one CamSkyGates with three inputs: AND/OR/MUX/BUFFER. The CamSkyGate is provided with the simulation of all input              combinations except "000".
